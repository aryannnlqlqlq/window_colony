an idle game
where you develop an ant colony
and im gonna use multiple windows to represent multiple chambers in the colony
kinda like window kill
where you have a main sand box area and smaller windows representing your chambers
and the sand box area has food and water shit like dew drops
and ants go collect them
and you can add more windows according to your level
and each window can host a certain number of ants and resources
and you can upgrade each window to house more ants and more resources
and we have like hauler ants and feeder ants and shit
hauler ants move food around
feeder ants feed the queen food

Core features 
Opening multiple windows
Ants assigned to specific windows
Way to collect spawn and feed the queen food
Some form of upgrading system
